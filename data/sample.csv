Twitter for iPhone,RT @TheRightMelissa: In an ironic twist of fate CNN HQ is being attacked by the very riots they promoted as noble &amp; just. Oops
Twitter for iPhone,RT @Jim_Jordan: Right on! We don't have to pay organizations to lie to us. They'll probably do it for free.

Twitter for iPhone,Looting leads to shooting and that's why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot. I don't want this to happen and that's what the expression put out last night means....
Twitter for iPhone,....It was spoken as a fact not as a statement. It's very simple nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters and those looking to cause trouble on social media. Honor the memory of George Floyd!
Twitter for iPhone,REVOKE 230!
Twitter for iPhone,The National Guard has arrived on the scene. They are in Minneapolis and fully prepared. George Floyd will not have died in vain. Respect his memory!!!
Twitter for iPhone,The National Guard has been activated In Minneapolis. They have arrived on the seen. George Floyd will not have died in vain. Respect his memory!!!
Twitter for iPhone,RT @LaraLeaTrump: Looting is not protesting. Burning down local homes and businesses is not protesting. How sad that the memory of #GeorgeF?
Twitter for iPhone,CHINA!
Twitter for iPhone,"""Regulate Twitter if they are going to start regulating free speech."" @JudgeJeanine @foxandfriends  Well as they have just proven conclusively that's what they are doing. Repeal Section 230!!!"
Twitter for iPhone,"""The President has been targeted by Twitter."" @MariaBartiromo  What about all of the lies and fraudulent statements made by Adam Schiff and so many others on the Russian Witch Hunt Plus Plus Plus? What about China's propaganda? WHO's mistakes? No flags?  @foxandfriends"
Twitter for iPhone,Twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies &amp; propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party. They have targeted Republicans Conservatives &amp; the President of the United States. Section 230 should be revoked by Congress. Until then it will be regulated!
Twitter for iPhone,I can't stand back &amp; watch this happen to a great American City Minneapolis. A total lack of leadership. Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor Jacob Frey get his act together and bring the City under control or I will send in the National Guard &amp; get the job done right.....
Twitter for iPhone,....These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd and I won't let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but when the looting starts the shooting starts. Thank you!
Twitter for iPhone,MAIL-IN VOTING WILL LEAD TO MASSIVE FRAUD AND ABUSE. IT WILL ALSO LEAD TO THE END OF OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY. WE CAN NEVER LET THIS TRAGEDY BEFALL OUR NATION. BIG MAIL-IN VICTORY IN TEXAS COURT TODAY. CONGRATS!!!
Twitter for iPhone,".@Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is today criticizing Twitter. ""We have a different policy than Twitter on this. I believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online."" Did Twitter criticize Obama for his ""you can keep your Dr.""?"
